Future ideas:

• The current system finds nearest stops using latitude and longitude but lacks geocoding to
  convert addresses to coordinates. Implementing geocoding requires obtaining user location or
  address and considering privacy. I can suggest adding a geocoding service or handling it
  client-side—would you like me to provide options?

• Right now it’s mainly stop/route/direction focused. It can be human‑friendly if the client
  can supply coordinates: search_stops(lat, lon) already finds nearby stops. What it can’t do
  yet is turn “near McGill” or “from 123 Main St to Place des Arts” into coordinates — that
  requires a geocoder.

  So yes, you could make it truly natural‑language by adding a geocoding step:

  - User input (address/place) → geocoder → lat/lon → search_stops for nearest stops
  - Then get_next_arrivals or (future) routing logic

  That would be a great Phase 5.5/6 idea, but it introduces a new external API and privacy
  considerations.

  If you want, we can add:

  1. a geocoding client (e.g., Nominatim or Google/Mapbox) and a resolve_location tool, or
  2. keep geocoding in the client and only send lat/lon to MCP.
